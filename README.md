## Assignment: Coding Challenge: JavaScript Part 2

### Description

The exercises below are to be done during and following your viewing of the resources.  Please push your completed project to a repository on Github.  Provide the link to your repo. Each activity should be appropriately labeled in its own folder.

**VERY EASY:** Write a function named min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

**EASY:** Create an array of students holding their last name, first name, and age with 3 students. To validate, please log a greeting with the first name, last name and age of the 2nd student. The output should look like "Hello, my name is John Doe and I'm 19 years old."

**MEDIUM:** Create a program that accepts a number (1-12) as input and logs to the console that number and its corresponding month. For example: if the user enters the number 3, then it should return the month “March.” Alert the user if they enter an invalid number (e.g. less than 1 or greater than 12).
 
**HARD:** Given the information below for Tom and Jerry. 
Tom -     height:  9in       mass: 8 g
Jerry -     height: 10in     mass: 45 g

Compare the BMI (Body Mass Index) of Tom & Jerry using the formula below:
    BMI = mass / height ^2 = mass / (height * height)

Store Tom & Jerry’s mass and height as variables. Calculate both their BMI’s. Create a Boolean variable containing information about whether Tom has a higher BMI than Jerry. Print a string to the console with the variable from step 3 ( e.g. Is Tom’s BMI higher than Jerry’s? false).
